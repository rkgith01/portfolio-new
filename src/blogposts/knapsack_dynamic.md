        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The Knapsack Problem stands as a testament to the ingenuity of computer science in tackling real-world optimization challenges. At its core, it asks a simple question: given a set of items each with a weight and value, how can we maximize the value of items we can fit into a knapsack of limited capacity? While seemingly straightforward, its implications are profound, with applications ranging from resource allocation in economics to resource management in computer science.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Understanding the Knapsack Problem</h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Before delving into the intricacies of its solution, let’s grasp the essence of the Knapsack Problem. Picture a traveler preparing for a journey, facing the dilemma of selecting the most valuable items while being mindful of the weight they can carry. Similarly, in computational terms, we aim to select a subset of items that yield the maximum value without surpassing the weight limit of the knapsack.

        <ol className="list-disc list-inside leading-relaxed px-6 mb-4" style="list-style-type:decimal;">
            <li>**Identify Subproblems**: Breaking down the problem into manageable subproblems is the first step towards finding an optimal solution.</li>
            <li>**Define Recurrence Relation**: Establishing the relationship between the solution to the original problem and its subproblems is crucial.</li>
            <li>**Develop Memoization or Tabulation**: With the blueprint of the solution in place, it’s time to implement it using either memoization or tabulation.</li>
            <li>**Optimize Space Complexity**: Efficiency is paramount, especially when dealing with large problem sizes.</li>
