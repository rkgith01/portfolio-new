        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">1. Parameterized Queries to Prevent SQL Injection:</h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
            SQL injection is a malicious attack that exploits vulnerabilities in SQL queries. To mitigate this risk, always use parameterized queries instead of concatenating user inputs directly into SQL statements. Here's a simple example using JavaScript and Node.js with the <code>mysql</code> library:
        </p>
        <pre className="overflow-x-scroll bg-black text-white p-4 rounded-lg m-4 border">
            <code className="language-javascript">
                const mysql = require('mysql');

                const connection = mysql.createConnection({
                  host: 'localhost',
                  user: 'username',
                  password: 'password',
                  database: 'mydatabase'
                });

                connection.connect();

                const username = req.body.username;
                const password = req.body.password;

                const sql = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?';
                connection.query(sql, [username, password], (error, results) => {
                  if (error) throw error;
                  console.log(results);
                });

                connection.end();
            </code>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">2. Sanitizing User Inputs to Mitigate XSS Attacks:</h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks occur when malicious scripts are injected into web pages viewed by other users. To prevent this, thoroughly sanitize and validate all user inputs, especially those displayed on web pages. Here's an example using JavaScript to sanitize user input before displaying it:
        </p>
        <pre className="overflow-x-scroll bg-black text-white p-4 rounded-lg m-4 border">
            <code className="language-javascript">
                function sanitizeInput(input) {
                  return input.replace(/<script.*?>|<\/script>/g, '');
                }

                const userInput = '&lt;script&gt;alert("XSS Attack!");&lt;/script&gt;';
                const sanitizedInput = sanitizeInput(userInput);
                console.log(sanitizedInput); // Output: alert("XSS Attack!");
            </code>
        </pre>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">3. Implementing Content Security Policy (CSP):</h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Content Security Policy (CSP) is an additional layer of security that helps detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including XSS. By defining and configuring a CSP for your web application, you can control which resources (e.g., scripts, stylesheets, images) are allowed to be loaded and executed. Here's an example of setting up a basic CSP header in Node.js:
        </p>
        <pre className="overflow-x-scroll bg-black text-white p-4 rounded-lg m-4 border">
            <code className="language-javascript">
                app.use((req, res, next) => {
                  res.setHeader('Content-Security-Policy', "default-src 'self'");
                  next();
                });
            </code>
        </pre>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Conclusion:</h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
            In the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats, it's crucial for web developers to prioritize security measures in their applications. By following best practices such as using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection, sanitizing user inputs to mitigate XSS attacks, and implementing Content Security Policy (CSP), we can significantly reduce the risk of common vulnerabilities and ensure the safety of our web applications and users' data.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Remember, security is not a one-time task but an ongoing process. Stay vigilant, keep updating your defenses, and prioritize security in every aspect of your web development journey.
