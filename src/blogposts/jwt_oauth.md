        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4" >Authentication vs. Authorization: Understanding the Basics</h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Before we dive into the specifics of implementing authentication and authorization, let's clarify the distinction between the two. Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, ensuring they are who they claim to be. On the other hand, authorization determines what actions a user is allowed to perform after they've been authenticated.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Handling Authentication in RESTful APIs</h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
            When it comes to implementing authentication in RESTful APIs, there are various methods to choose from. One popular approach is JSON Web Tokens (JWT). JWT is a compact, self-contained mechanism for transmitting authentication information between parties as a JSON object.
        </p>
        <pre className="overflow-x-scroll bg-black text-white p-4 rounded-lg m-4 border">
            <code className="language-javascript">
                const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

                // Generate JWT token
                const generateToken = (user) => {
                  return jwt.sign({ userId: user.id }, 'secret', { expiresIn: '1h' });
                };

                // Verify JWT token
                const verifyToken = (token) => {
                  return jwt.verify(token, 'secret');
                };
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p className="leading-relaxed mt-4">
            In this example, we have functions to generate and verify JWT tokens using the <code>jsonwebtoken</code> library in Node.js. The token is signed with a secret key and has an expiration time to enhance security.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Understanding OAuth</h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Now, let's shift our focus to OAuth. OAuth is an open standard for access delegation commonly used for enabling secure authorization in APIs. It allows a user's account information to be used by third-party services without exposing their credentials.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Key Differences between OAuth and JWT</h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
           While both OAuth and JWT are used for authentication and authorization, they serve different purposes and operate at different levels of the authentication process. OAuth is primarily concerned with delegated authorization and access control, whereas JWT focuses on representing claims securely between parties.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
         In summary, OAuth is a framework for authorization, while JWT is a compact token format for securely transmitting information. They can complement each other in a comprehensive authentication and authorization strategy.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Authentication and authorization are crucial components of any RESTful API. By understanding the differences between OAuth and JWT and how to implement them effectively, you can ensure the security and integrity of your API.
