        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Understanding CI/CD</h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Before we get started, let's quickly recap what CI/CD is all about. Continuous Integration involves automatically building and testing code changes as soon as they are committed to the repository. On the other hand, Continuous Deployment automates the process of deploying code changes to production environments after passing through the CI phase.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Choosing the Right Tools</h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
            For our CI/CD pipeline, I've selected some popular tools in the development community:
        </p>
        <ol className="list-disc ml-8">
            <li>**Git** - Version Control System</li>
            <li>**GitHub** - Code Hosting Platform</li>
            <li>**Jenkins** - CI/CD Automation Server</li>
            <li>**Docker** - Containerization Platform</li>
            <li>**Kubernetes** - Container Orchestration</li>
        </ol>

        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Now, let's walk through the steps of setting up our CI/CD pipeline:
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal ml-8" style="list-style-type:decimal;">
            <li>**Configure GitHub Repository**: Start by creating a GitHub repository for your web application.</li>
            <li>**Install Jenkins**: Set up Jenkins on your server or use a cloud-based solution.</li>
            <li>**Create Jenkins Pipeline**: Define a Jenkins pipeline that includes stages for building, testing, and deploying your web application.</li>
            <li>**Containerize Your Application**: Dockerize your web application by creating a Dockerfile.</li>
            <li>**Deploy with Kubernetes**: Set up a Kubernetes cluster and deploy your Docker containers.</li>
        </ol>
