        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Time complexity optimization serves as the cornerstone of crafting efficient algorithms. It revolves around the art of reducing the time it takes for algorithms to execute. This process delves deep into scrutinizing algorithmic performance, seeking areas ripe for enhancement, whether through minimizing redundant computations or fine-tuning data structures.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Example Problem: Finding the Maximum Element in an Array</h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Let's delve into a fundamental problem: finding the maximum element in an array.
        </p>
        <pre className="bg-black text-white p-4 rounded-lg m-4 border overflow-x-scroll">
        <code className="language-python">
            def find_max(arr):
                max_element = float('-inf')
                for num in arr:
                    if num > max_element:
                        max_element = num
                return max_element
        </code>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Approach to Optimization</h2>
        <ol className="list-disc list-inside leading-relaxed px-6" style="list-style-type:decimal;">
            <li>Analyze the Current Solution: We start by understanding the existing algorithm's time complexity. Here, our solution boasts a time complexity of O(n), where n represents the array's size.</li>
            <li>Identify Bottlenecks: Pinpoint the segments of the algorithm that significantly contribute to its time complexity. In our case, it's the loop traversing the array, acting as the primary bottleneck.</li>
            <li>Optimization Techniques: Embrace optimization techniques to streamline performance. Strategies range from curbing redundant computations to leveraging more efficient data structures or even incorporating algorithmic marvels like binary search.</li>
        </ol>

    <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Improved Solution</h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Enter the optimized realm. One approach is to sort the array first and pluck the last element, bringing the time complexity to O(n log n) due to sorting, yet accessing the maximum becomes a swift O(1) operation.
        </p>
        <pre className="bg-black p-4 text-white rounded-lg m-1 border overflow-x-scroll ">
            <code className="language-python">
                def find_max_optimized(arr):
                    arr.sort()
                    return arr[-1]

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Test and Validate</h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Validation is key. Ensure the optimized solution maintains correctness and undergoes rigorous testing across varying input sizes, affirming tangible improvements.
