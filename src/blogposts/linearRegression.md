        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Understanding Linear Regression</h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">At its essence, Linear Regression aims to find the best-fitting straight line through a set of data points.</p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
             This line is represented by the equation: \[ y = mx + c \]

            <li>\( y \) is the dependent variable (the variable we want to predict).</li>
            <li>\( x \) is the independent variable (the variable we use to make predictions).</li>
            <li> \( m \) is the slope of the line.</li>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Implementation in Python</h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Let's delve into some Python code to see how we can implement Linear Regression using the popular library, scikit-learn.
        </p>
        <pre className="overflow-x-scroll bg-black text-white p-4 rounded-lg m-4 border"><code class="language-python">import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Sample data

X = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]])
y = np.array([2, 4, 5, 4, 6])

# Initialize Linear Regression model

model = LinearRegression()

# Fit the model to the data

model.fit(X, y)

# Predict using the model

new_x = np.array([[6]])
prediction = model.predict(new_x)
print("Prediction for {}: {}".format(new_x[0][0], prediction[0]))</code></pre>

<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Visualization</h2>
<p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
Visualizing the results of our Linear Regression model can provide deeper insights into how well it fits the data. Let's visualize the line that our model has learned to draw.
</p>
<pre className="overflow-x-scroll bg-black text-white p-4 rounded-lg m-4 border"><code class="language-python">import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot the data points

plt.scatter(X, y, color='blue')

# Plot the regression line

plt.plot(X, model.predict(X), color='red')

# Add labels and title

plt.xlabel('X')
plt.ylabel('y')
plt.title('Linear Regression')

# Show plot

plt.show()</code></pre>
